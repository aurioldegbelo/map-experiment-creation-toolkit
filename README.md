## How-To
<details>
    <summary>Create and launch an experiment</summary>

<details>
    <summary>Using Docker</summary>

1. Create a new JSON file in the directory `<repository>/public/experiments/`, e.g. `example.json`.
2. Edit the created JSON file to your likings to configure a new experiment.
3. Create a new file in the root directory of your project called `.env` with the following content:
```bash
VITE_EXPERIMENT_ID = <File name of your JSON config file>
```
4. Start the application in a Docker container by using the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
5. Open your web browser and go to `localhost:3000`.

    </summary>

### MapData
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **source** | string | mandatory | - | The file name of the data to be visualized. You do not need to specify a whole file path, in case you put the file in the default data directory.

        <b>Variable</b>
    </summary>

 ### Variable
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **id** | string | mandatory | - | The name of the variable provided in the dataset. See the [example](#example) below. |
| label | string | optional | "" | An alternative label for the variable in case the default name is not meaningful. The label is displayed in the map's legend for example. |
| unit | string | optional | "" | The unit of the variable. This is displayed in the map's legend for example. By default, no unit is being provided with the data. | 

#### Example 
Consider the following snippet from an example dataset:

```json
"properties": {
    "OBJECTID": 1,
    "NAME": "Texas",
    "VALUE": 32.4
}
```
If you want to visualize the variable `"VALUE"`, you have to specify the `id` as `"VALUE"`. Since the variable name is not very meaningful in this case, you can use an alternative label by providing the `label` property (e.g. `"Obesity"`). Since there is no unit being provided you can specify the `unit` property as well (e.g. `"%"`) to improve the description of your data.
